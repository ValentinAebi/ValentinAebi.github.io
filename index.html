<p class="project">
    <p class="project_type">Research project, <a href="https://systemf.epfl.ch/">EPFL SYSTEMF laboratory</a>, 2023-2024</p>
    <p class="tags_list">Keywords: Java compiler plugin, JVM bytecode, Debuggers, Program tracing</p>
    <p class="project_descr">
        For my master semester projects, I contributed to SYSTEMF's
        <a href="https://systemf.epfl.ch/research.html#immediate-tracing-for-smoother-debugging-and-code-exploration"
        >Immediate tracing</a>
        project, whose goal is to record the evolution of the state of a program and display it as an execution trace.
        My work was focused on implementing such a tool for Java. The first version
        was based on bytecode instrumentation (<a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/303503?ln=en">report</a>).
        The second version consists of a plugin for the Java compiler.

<summary class="project_title">&nbsp; The Rattlesnake programming language &nbsp;
    <a href="https://github.com/ValentinAebi/Rattlesnake"><i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size: larger;"></i></a>
</summary>
<p class="project">
    <p class="project_type">Personal project, started in 2022</p>
    <p class="tags_list">Keywords: Language design, Compiler, JVM bytecode, Scala</p>
    <p class="project_descr">
        Simple imperative programming language, compiled to JVM bytecode by a compiler written in Scala. It started at the end of my bachelor's 
        as a mean for me to learn more about compilers, and evolved into a platform for small experiments in language design. The language 
        is small, but provides enough features to write meaningful programs of several hundreds of lines of code (see the sudoku solver in this 
        list). Its features include arrays, nominal structures and interfaces, smart casts, and (shallow) mutability control. Its main 
        limitations are the lack of IOs (the only one being prints to the console), the absence of a module system (all functions are top-level),
        the non-interoperability with other JVM-based languages, and the absence of closures and higher-order functions.

</summary>
<p class="project">
    <p class="project_type">Personal project, started in 2024</p>
    <p class="tags_list">Keywords: Bug detection, Z3 SMT solver, JVM bytecode, Kotlin</p>
    <p class="project_descr">
        A bug detection engine for Java-based languages, written in Kotlin. It uses symbolic execution to compute feasible 
        paths in methods and detect errors like null dereferences, out-of-bound array accesses, and divisions by zero. It is currently an early 
        prototype due to lack of time to work on it. In its current state, the engine is able to perform intra-procedural analysis and to generate 
        methods summaries. The actual usage of method summaries for inter-procedural analysis is however not (yet) implemented.

    <a href="https://github.com/FV-Rattlesnake-team/Rattlesnake"><i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size: larger;"></i></a>
</summary>
<p class="project">
    <p class="project_type">Course project, Fall semester 2022</p>
    <p class="tags_list">Keyword: Program verification, Formal methods, Z3 SMT solver, Scala</p>
    <p class="project_descr">
        As part of EPFL's <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/formal-verification-CS-550" style="font-style: italic;">Formal verification</a> class, we had to 
        complete a project related to formal methods. My teammates and I chose to implement a verifying compiler for a subset of 
        Rattlesnake, a language that I had created as a free-time project. Our verifier is able to check Rattlesnake programs that 
        use integers and booleans. We have been able to prove simple properties like the absence of out-of-bounds errors in array 
        iterations. Due to time constraints, we had to limit ourselves to sound approximations about values loaded from arrays and structures.

        A calculator to balance chemical equations and compute quantities involved in chemical reactions, written in Rust. The

        An "intelligent" sudoku solver, that implements reasoning rules and heuristics to limit the use of backtracking. This 
        solver is written in Rattlesnake, serving as the largest example program for this toy language.

    <p class="project_descr">
        The goal of the project was to build a linter for Scala to check that some features of the language are not used 
        (typically it could be used to guarantee that programs are functional). I also worked on a prototype tool that 
        transforms (some) imperative Scala programs into equivalent functional programs, the goal being to help students 
        understand functional programming.
